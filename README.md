# Logic Circuit Builder in Java

## __Description__
This application gives the user the ability to build and simulate a digital logic circuit by dragging logic gates onto the circuit board grid area, connecting them with wires, changing the input pins, and running a simulation of the circuit to see what it would output.

## __Features__
 • Drag-and-drop logic gates for an interactive logic circuit builder
 • User selects where to place wires and clicks to make perpendicular bends
 • User can choose to add up to 9 input and output pins for added complexity to circuits
 • User can, upon finishing their circuit, select the test button to see how a digital signal would run through their circuit
